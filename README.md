Hi there, thank you for visiting my page! I am a sophmore at Purdue University and I have created this page with the intention of sharing my progress in learning CTF, which I will be updating frequently with write ups of challenges I have completed. I am currently looking for work opportunities both part time during the school year and full time in the summer.
